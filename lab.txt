The current lab setup has:

Oracle Linux VM running Ansible 2.4.

* (2) Cisco CSR1000v routers
* (1) Cisco ASAv
* (1) Cisco WLCv
* (1) Cisco Catalyst 3850
* (1) Cisco Catalyst 4510 w/ dual sup8's

I am using a hybrid of virtualization within EVE-NG and physical equipment to
help with upgrades and issues with virtualized systems.

Eventually will be adding a Palo Alto Networks firewall, Juniper vSRX, and Arista vEOS devices.
